## Introduction

This is a facial recognition bot. It will recognize a face in any picture you upload. 
If your picture has more than one face it will only capture one.
This app is connected to a PostgreSQL database.

## What I used

### Front-end: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

### Back-end: 
Node.js, Express.js

### Database: 
PostgreSQL

### Other: 
Knex, Bcrypt

## What I learned

This project was a big challenge to my Javascript and React knowledge. 
The goal was to create an interactive face recognition, connected to a database which stores user information and credentials.
Through this project I was able to understand how to create a react app and how react components interact with one another.
I learned about state and props and how the parent components pass down information and receive from children components.
I also learned how to integrate the front-end and back-end of an app and how to connect to a database.
